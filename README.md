automatorm
==========

A simple to use ORM in PHP, that reads your database schema directly, without having to run code generators, or create schema documents.

Requirements:

PHP 5.4, mysqli, composer

Currently relies on my random library "HodgePodge", but I plan to decouple the code from this soon.
